# Wearable-device-tracker Course Project
This is the course project for getting and cleaning data.
The R script used here is run_analysis.R and does the following tasks:
  1. Load the required libraries for project execution.
  2. Load the training and test sets and then merge them.
  3. Load the activity labels and feature from the data provided and convert them to character class from factors for string manipulation.
  4. Provide descriptive names to the activities and labels in the dataset.
  5. Create an independent tidy data set and save it as "tidy.txt" which contains the average value of each variable for each subject and        activity pair.
